In today's world, engagement on a website can often lead to a fragmented viewing experience that takes users to different webpages and tabs. This fragmentation creates challenges for data collection as users are moving away from the site. Pagedip works to solve for this by containing all engagement within the page through unique widgets such as sliders, tab-its, overlays, and so on. These widgets allow for a wide variety of content to be displayed on a single webpage in a simplistic and digestible manner.

Pagedip collects data on user engagement across its pagedips and widgets. This data has the potential to drive insights that would allow for companies to optimize their web experience by better understanding how users are interacting with the site and which content is performing best or underperforming. The problem we are solving for is enabling Pagedip to provide engagement analytics to their clients in a meaningful way that offer insight into how users are interacting with pagedips. For this analysis, we will be using an anonymous clientâ€™s data for their internal sales training pagedips.
